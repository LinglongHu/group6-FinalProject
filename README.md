Group6-Final Project

This project analyzes NYC Uber ride-sharing and taxi data from January 2020 to August 2024, focusing on travel patterns and weather impacts. It is divided into 4 main steps, data processing, storing data,  understanding data, and visualizing data. The project includes six key visualizations, such as popular ride times, airport drop-off trends, fare breakdowns, tip analysis, and a geospatial heatmap of ride density. Data management is handled using SQLAlchemy, with visualizations created using Panda, and Folium.
